# Simple weather app
This is a lab excercise from Red Academy Web Development Professional Program, Spring 2018
Objective: to create a simple app to fetch current informationa about weather in Vancouver. I exchange the fixed city info with geolocation statment and data, so if app shows the current place weather information. I've also added the date.

##featured used
* fetching data from Open Weather API by using ajax method;
* jQuery;
* styling inspired by google material design;

### to be continued... (status as of April 29. 2018)
* Structure was NOT yet customized to be mobile-first - it will be rewritten soon;
* I did not use node-modules, GULP or SASS yet. Will do that soon;
* Nice to have: time displayed;
* I have problems with http:// and https:// on Github and the app might not work, when you check it, clicking on the link in description. I will fix it as soon as possible;
* Some of requirements cover the FreeCodeCamp Front End Developer challenge: [Show the Local Weather];(https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather), but no all user-stories was used.
* I would like to use this awesome icons in future: [link to codepen] (https://codepen.io/joshbader/pen/EjXgqr)
